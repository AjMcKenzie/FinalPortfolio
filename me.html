            <p class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a page dedicated to talk all about <span class="bold">me</span> (Andrew McKenzie). I am currently 16 years old and a sophomore at Davenport West High school. I will graduate in year 2020. I plan on going to BYU
                Idaho when I graduate High school. I want to be a programmer or an animator I have lived in Iowa for a year but I was living in Europe before I moved here. I was living in Trondheim, Norway. I was born in Seattle, Washington and moved to Norway when I was 11 years old.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;
                &nbsp;I like to do coding and making websites, its really fun to learn how to do it. I like using the computer whether it is coding, drawing, playing, or programming. I don't really know what else to say about myself. I like to figure
                stuff out on my own for example, if I wanted to add something new into my code I would try to do it by myself before I ask/look for help.</p>
