    <p class="p">This is a page dedicated to talk all about <span class="bold">me</span>. I am currently 15 years old and a sophomore at Davenport West High school. I will graduate in year 2020. I like to do coding and making websites, its really fun to learn how
        to do it. I like using the computer whether it is coding, drawing, playing, or programming. I have lived in Iowa for a year but I was living in Europe before I moved here. The countrie I was living in at the time was Norway. I was born
        in Seattle, Washington so I am an Amarican I was just living in Norway. </p>
