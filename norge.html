            <p class="p">&nbsp;&nbsp;On this page I could talk about anything. So I decided to talk about <span class="i">Norge </span>(Norway). I lived there for 4 years and moved there when I was 11 years old. Norway is in Europe and it is by Sweden. Most people
                don't even know about Norway and what language they speak. In Norway the speak <span class="i">Norsk </span>(Norwegian). <br><br> Now that is done I will talk more aboout <span class="i">Norge</span> and its history and terrain. Norway
                was had a lot of Vikings during that time period. In 1523 Norway was part of <span class="i">Danmark-Norge</span> (Denmark-Norway) that was when Denmark and Norway was in a Union. Going ahead a few years to the year of 1814 that was the
                time of <span class="i">Den svenks-norsk union</span> (Sweden-Norway) Sweden and Norway became united. Skipping a head a couple of years to the year of 1905 <span class="i">Syttende mai</span> (17 May). Norway finally gained its indapendec.
                This day is celabrated every year and is called <span class="i">Syttende mai</span> (17 May) and <span class="i">Nasjonaldagen</span> (The National Day).
                <br><br> Now that the history is done the Geography of Norway is <span class="i">fjellene</span> (mountains), <span class="i">skoger</span> (forest), <span class="i">fjorder</span> (fjords), and a couple places have <span class="i">isbreer</span>                (glaciers).</p>
