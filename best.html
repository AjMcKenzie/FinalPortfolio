            <p class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp;In ths class we did a lot of projects and I now have to display the projects I think are my best.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first one that I think I did good on was my recipe page. For that page we had to find 5 recipes and make
                a web page for them. <br> &nbsp;
                <a href="Recipes.html">This</a> is a link to my Recipes page. <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Another one that I though I did pretty good on was my dounut page. For this one we had to look at an image of the already done web page and then make
                it. <br> &nbsp;Want to <a href="donuts.html">see</a> a donut page?<br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;My favorite project we did was when we changed the West Highs social media page. We all worked together and made this page using <a href="github.html">Github</a>.
                We had to update the original because it wasn't good.<br> &nbsp;
                <a href="https://davenportwest.github.io/socialMedia/index.html">Visit</a> the social media page. <br><br> Those are only some of my projects that I did but they are consider my best.</p>
